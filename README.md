# Sabor Express - OO

This project was developed during a Python course.

The goal is to develop a delivery restaurant platform where the owner or administrator can register a restaurant, activate or deactivate it, and create the restaurantâ€™s menu. It is possible to add dishes, drinks, and desserts separately, as well as apply discounts.
